    blurb: `I thought I knew who I was—a simple Elemental, content in my quiet corner of Mysthaven, where the only battles I fought were against the elements themselves. But when the night came alive with fire and fury, everything I loved was ripped away. My home lies in ruins, my family has vanished, and I’m left alone to navigate a world far darker than I ever imagined.
    <br/>They say destiny has plans for me, but I never asked for this. As I journey through a land where danger hides in every shadow, I’m forced to become something I never wanted to be. Power, it seems, comes with a price, and the path I must walk is one of trials and secrets—secrets that could unravel the very fabric of Mysthaven.
    <br/> Of Shadow and Argent is the story of my search for the truth, of the choices I never wanted to make, and the unseen forces that now shape my life. In a world where nothing is as it seems, I’m left to question who I can trust and who I am meant to be.
    <br/> But one thing is certain: I will find my family, no matter the cost. The question is, what will I become in the process?`,

    cover: "/images/ofancover.png",
    blurb: `I thought the hardest part of my journey was behind me. I was wrong.
    <br/>Power courses through my veins, ancient and volatile, but power alone is never enough. Not when old enemies wear new masks. Not when secrets weave deeper than I ever imagined, binding me to those I can’t trust and pulling me toward truths I’m not ready to face.
    <br/>The realms teeter on the edge of war, and everyone looks to me—to lead, to destroy, to save. But how can I protect the people I love when I’m still learning what it means to survive the darkness within?
    <br/>
    Fate has plans for me, nightmares whisper promises I can’t ignore, and shadows stir where even the stars won’t shine. My choices will reshape the realms—or end them.
    <br/>
    All I know is this: the deeper I go, the harder it becomes to tell friend from foe... or even who I am anymore.
    <br/>
    But with my shadows hungrier than ever and my past unraveling before me, one thing is clear: the only way out is through.
    <br/>
    Through war. Through nightmares. Through fate itself.
    <br/>
    Because if I fall, so do they all.
