    cover: "/images/cover.png",
    blurb: `I thought I knew who I was—a simple Elemental, content in my quiet corner of Mysthaven, where the only battles I fought were against the elements themselves. But when the night came alive with fire and fury, everything I loved was ripped away. My home lies in ruins, my family has vanished, and I’m left alone to navigate a world far darker than I ever imagined.
    <br/>They say destiny has plans for me, but I never asked for this. As I journey through a land where danger hides in every shadow, I’m forced to become something I never wanted to be. Power, it seems, comes with a price, and the path I must walk is one of trials and secrets—secrets that could unravel the very fabric of Mysthaven.
    <br/> Of Shadow and Argent is the story of my search for the truth, of the choices I never wanted to make, and the unseen forces that now shape my life. In a world where nothing is as it seems, I’m left to question who I can trust and who I am meant to be.
    <br/> But one thing is certain: I will find my family, no matter the cost. The question is, what will I become in the process?`,
